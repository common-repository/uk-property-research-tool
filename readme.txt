 == Description == 
Development of the Property Research Tool was funded by donations by members of the Property118 landlords forum which has nearly 200,000 members.

The mission of the Property118 group is to facilitate the sharing of best practice amongst UK landlords, tenants, homeowners and letting agents.

The Property Research Tool works particularly well in England and Wales and some functionality is also applicable in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

Users simply input a UK postcode and press search to open up 24 data feeds from renowned sources including the likes of; Google Street View, Rightmove, HM Land Registry, Environment Agency, and the Police. 

Property118 operates on a not for profit basis but did have one corporate sponsor to fund the development of the Property Research Tool. 

This is an equity finance provider for Buy to Let Landlords and they have a banner at the foot of the search results which links back to a forum discussion about their product on Property118. 

There are two other banners, one of which promotes the Wordpress Property Research Tool Plugin and the other promotes free membership of the Property118 community.
